History
----------

**VkMessenger** was started at September, 2013 as replacement to deprecated VK XMPP gate support. The company management of Mail.ru Group has provided no official client for desktop still. So I decided to create an alternative solution, because it's very uncomfortable to write messages to my friends in a browser. But I spent on development only my free time if it was, so it passed 3 years when I decided to publish the first alpha version. Also I'm not plan to provide new features & bugs support, so you can take part in code development, please contact with me on official website. But I use this program every day, so it's big probability that it will be in stable state.
